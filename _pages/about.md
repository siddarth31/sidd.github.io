I am a Principal Research Scientist at <a href='https://www.merl.com/'>MERL</a>, where my research tackles foundational problems in computer vision and machine learning for robotic autonomy. My work centers on developing data-driven and geometric algorithms that enhance robots’ ability to perceive, interpret, and interact with their environments, enabling advances in human–robot collaboration and industrial automation. I also serve as an Associate Editor for IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RAL).

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from <a href='https://www.northwestern.edu/'>Northwestern University</a>. My doctoral research focused on probabilistic models for human intent recognition and adaptive assistance in shared autonomy for assistive teleoperation. I also developed perception algorithms that combine geometric methods with machine learning to detect high-level navigation and manipulation goals for autonomous systems. In collaboration with the 
<a href='https://www.sralab.org/'>Shirley Ryan AbilityLab</a> in Chicago, my work led to research solutions involving user studies and interactive robotic systems designed to support people in practical applications.
